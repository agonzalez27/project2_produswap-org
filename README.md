###Project Description 
In the area in which I live, many families grow a variety produce in their back yards.  Most of the time, their plants and trees yield surplus produce that is not consumed.  My goal is to create a site that connects users with surplus produce so that can "swap" it.  This will save families money as well as prevent food from being wasted.  

###MVP
A site where users can:

1.  Create, edit, and delete a profile.  
2.  Create, edit, or delete a post or "Swap".
3.  Read posts from other users.
4. 	 Message users via the post page.
5. 	 Reply to messages on the post page.



###Stretch Goals
In the future, I would like swappers to be able to rate each other.  I would also like to send either text or email notifications when someone replies to or sends a message.  If time allows, I will also allow users to upload photos of their produce.  

###Technologies Used
HTML5, SCSS, Bootstrap, postgreSQL, BCrypt, and Ruby on Rails.
